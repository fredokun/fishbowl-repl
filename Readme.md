**Important** : this is beta-quality software, expect (and please report) some bugs... 

## Requirements ##

To try cl-jupyter you need :

 - a Common lisp implementation, for now

   - either SBCL 1.2.x or above (with native threads enabled)

   - or Clozure CL 1.10 or above (with native threads enabled) ...

   - ECL is planned, for other implementations please fill an issue.

 - Quicklisp (cf. http://www.quicklisp.org)

 - Python 3.x (cf. http://www.python.org)

 - Jupyter (a.k.a. IPython 4.x) or IPython 3.x (cf. http://www.jupyter.org)

## Quick install ##

Please run the installation script :

    python3 ./install-cl-jupyter.py

By default, cl-jupyter assumes SBCL as the default lisp implementation. Using CCL instead requires
the following command line:

    python3 ./install-cl-jupyter.py  --lisp=ccl

**Note**: cl-jupyter seems to work better with CCL on MacOS but on Linux everything's fine with SBCL
 and it is the most tested configuration. Alas, it seems cl-jupyter does *not* work on Windows (I cannot try myself).
 If using a VM I would recommend the Linux/SBCL configuration.

As an optional step, you can pre-install the quicklisp dependencies to avoid
a veeeerrrry long first startup.

  - using SBCL

        sbcl --load ./cl-jupyter.lisp

  - using CCL

        ccl --load ./cl-jupyter.lisp

## Running cl-jupyter

The console mode is a simple REPL that is useful to
check that cl-jupyter is working.

### Console mode

 - for Jupyter

        jupyter console --kernel=lisp

 - for IPython 3.x

        ipython3 console --kernel=lisp

### Notebooks

The real interest of cl-jupyter is its use conjointly
 with the Jupyter notebook frontend. For a try, type:

  - for Jupyter

        jupyter notebook

  - for IPython 3.x

        ipython3 notebook

The file [about-cl-jupyter.ipynb](https://github.com/fredokun/cl-jupyter/blob/master/about-cl-jupyter.ipynb) is an example of a Lisp-based notebook.

The file [about-cl-jupyter.pdf](https://github.com/fredokun/cl-jupyter/blob/master/about-cl-jupyter.pdf) is a printable PDF version of this notebook that can be generated by the Jupyter `nbconvert` tool.
